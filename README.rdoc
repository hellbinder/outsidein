== Outside in application

This is a test app using cucumber and rspec for testing. This is a very simple approach yet it hepled me understand a couple of things.


== Overview

Just one thing that I almost forgot. <tt>It's on the rails page anyways</tt>
When using a partial, you can send the instance variable and it will be included in that partial.

For ex. render partial:@models

will call a _model partial with each model already.
